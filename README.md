# term-based-sentiment-prediction

      For properly running the code follow the below steps:

      1) cd path/absa
      2) Install all the dependencies using the requirement.txt
      3) If you want to train the model its code is availabel at notebooks/main_intern_train.py
      4) For getting the results for any csv file you can run the code at src/evaluation.py.

         Results are stored at data/results/test_data.csv

      5) If you want to see a live demo of the project you can run it by typing the following command: streamlit run src/evaluation_streamlit.py




**MODEL ARCHITECTURE**

![alt text](https://github.com/HardikArora17/term-based-sentiment-prediction/blob/main/model_architecture.jpg)

**MODEL DESCRIPTION**

●	**Word embeddings layer** - For calculating embeddings for the sentence as well as for the aspect phrase I tried different ways :

1)	Transformer based embeddings(Bert and Roberta) 
2)	Normal nn.Embeddings layer available in pytorch without any externa weights
3)	Static Glove Embeddings  **(finally used in model)**


The problem with approach 1 is that it gives you an  embedding with 768 features ,which is practically possible for the model to learn due to less training data

The problem with approach 2 was better than approach 1 but was not giving good results maybe again due to lack of learning 

Due to all this I used approach 3 for creating the word embeddings , I used standard           6B.100d glove version for creating 100 dimension ,sentence and word embeddings , I also tried with 50 dimension and 200 dimension but this was giving the best results in our favour.

●	**BILSTM LAYER**-  Since I used static word embeddings  , words are actually deprived of any context in their vicinity. To solve this I used  a simple bi-lstm network for  generating contextualized word embeddings

●	**Feed Forward layers**-  After getting embeddings for both the aspect phrase as well as for the text , I used some linear layers so that the model could find useful features and establish relationships between input and output. 

●	**Softmax Layer**-  At last I used a softmax layer for predicting the sentiment. 


Since this is a multi class problem I used a cross entropy loss as my loss function . I used Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 . All the dropout layers have a dropout rate of 0.3. I trained the model for 30 epochs ,with a batch size of 16 on Google Colab.

**LOSS CURVE**

For the purpose of evaluating my model I used  f1 score (both label wise and overall)

![alt text](https://github.com/HardikArora17/term-based-sentiment-prediction/blob/main/image.png)

I preferred using 100 dimension embeddings due its more f1 score on the positive class ,and as mentioned the score for positive class has more importance.

**Error Analysis**

**1)	Confusion due to neutral looking like negative words(or semantically less negative words)**

Example-
●	 This app works great but could you please PLEASE add an audio alert?

Aspect Name- audio

Predicted- neutral  

True-Negative

●	 I wasted so much time with different project managers itâc™s ridiculous because the air table was right there all along.
      
Aspect Name- project

Predicted- neutral

True-Negative

●	 Less in the free version, it has enough features to work on projects.

Aspect Name- free

Predicted- neutral

True-Negative




**2) Aspect term itself has some negative sentiment**

●	good afternoon, i would like to remove a logo i no longer use, its in the logo section.

Aspect Phrase- remove
            
Predicted- Negative

True-      Neutral

**3) Some errors in the dataset itself**

●	notion for desktop, web and mobile is good, but the ipad version is not good, interface is not properly scaled for the screen size and resolution.

Aspect Term- Ipad version

True - Positive

Predicted- Negative 

         
●	google docs and sheets have this.

Aspect Name- Sheets
True-         Negative

Predicted- Neutral

●	Love this app and it works supertly for planning work.

Aspect Name- planning

True-Neutral

Predicted-Positive

**4)  Some vague sentences**

●	one of the main principles of gtd is having all of the todo list in one place seems simple but has so much benefit.

Aspect Name- todo list

True- Positive

Predicted- Negative

**5) Biased a little towards negative words**

●	great tool overall, but booting up the application on android takes way too long.

Aspect Name- tool

True      -  positive

Predicted -  negative

●	Can't we add reminders to tasks in the free version?

Aspect Name- free
True      -  neutral

Predicted -  negative

●	i want to clear my card details for my profile, can you help me on here?

 Aspect Name- profile

 True-       Negative
 
 Predicted-  Neutral
